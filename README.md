# HelperTools
 
This will be a collection of helper tools that I have found to be useful in my development projects.
I plan to add more tools as I meet new challenges. Most of the tools will probably be in C++, and work in Windows.

## What's inside
### [sleep_signal_osc](https://github.com/sonnyky/HelperTools/tree/master/sleep_signal_osc)
* Utility tools to generate and process a Ctrl Break event
* Using OSC, the event can be further communicated to other processes that doesn't have the ability to process OS events due to framework limitations etc.
* See the project for further details
